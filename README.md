# INFO 441 Final Project

This project is a music quiz website which allows users to play music from their own spotify application, and then guess the current song being played. It is perfect to test yourself or your friends!

## Running the code

To install all node modules, run this command:
```
npm install
```

Add .env file with this information:
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='fdaa99c613cb4bf9bf318c248586427c'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='be11aa4fe3874ed4a4e0150f2ead388d'
```

Start both client and server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The React application will start on `http://localhost:3000`
